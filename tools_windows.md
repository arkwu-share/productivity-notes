# Tools to increase productivity

This is the page where I share some (mostly free) tools and experience aiming to increase productivity in general.

## 7zip - a file archiver with a high compression ratio.
I know a lot of people using winrar, but 7zip is a much better and free tool for compress and decompression(despite its UI). Another use is to use the command line to perform batch tasks.
